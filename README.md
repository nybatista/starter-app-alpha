# SpyneJS Starter App

**Repository:** [spynejs-starter-app](https://github.com/nybatista/spynejs-starter-app.git)

A clean, production-ready template for building **SpyneJS** applications.  
Start new projects quickly with a structure that reflects the View–Behavior–Logic (VBL) architecture from the very first line of code.

This starter can be cloned directly or generated via [`spyne-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spyne-cli).

## Features

**VBL Architecture by Default**
- ViewStreams, Channels, and Traits cleanly separated from day one.

**Webpack Development and Production Environments**
- Hot reloading with `npm start`, optimized production builds with `npm run build`.
- Dynamic static asset handling (`/imgs/` prefix).

**Static Directory for Content**
- Fonts, images, and other assets load cleanly in both development and production modes.

**SCSS Integration**
- SASS/SCSS support out of the box for scalable styling.

**Unit Testing with Web Test Runner**
- Preconfigured Mocha & Chai testing environment.

**Linting and Formatting**
- ESLint rules for consistent code quality and formatting.
